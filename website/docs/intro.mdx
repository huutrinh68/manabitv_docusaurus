### Summary
Currently, I work on machine learning with an emphasis on deep learning. My research area is in the interdisciplinary field of machine learning: computer vision and speech, reinforcement learning, information retrieval in Big Data, which specifically includes video understanding, high-dimensional streaming data, weakly supervised learning on noisy data, etc.  
With a practical get the things done approach, I am also passionate about the automation of IT processes which automate development processes quickly, safely, and at scale to multi-distributed-clouds spreading worldwide locations.
